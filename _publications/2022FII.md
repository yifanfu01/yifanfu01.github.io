I finished this article in Beihang University with Dr. Zhirong GUO and under the supervision from Dr. Shaocong MO and Prof. Wenchao GU in 2022.  
  
In this work, we pioneered the identification of shared genetic pathways between Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and COVID-19-induced cognitive impairments, utilizing integrated single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data to uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention. Our findings illuminate potential avenues for preventing and treating cognitive dysfunction in COVID-19 patients, marking a significant step forward in neurodegenerative disease research.
