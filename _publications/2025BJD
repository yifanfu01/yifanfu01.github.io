I finished this article in the department of dermatology, PUMCH with Dr. Wu, Dr. Pang in 2025, supervised by Prof. Hongzhong Jin, Dr. Chen.

In this work, This work uncovered the molecular mechanism and therapeutic potential of IL-36 signaling in Sweet syndrome. By integrating single-cell resolution spatiotemporal transcriptomics and mIF, we revealed that heterogeneous maturation neutrophils drive IL-36 activation through neutrophil elastase–mediated processing, forming a feed-forward inflammatory loop with keratinocytes and CD8⁺ T cells. Treatment with the anti–IL-36R antibody Spesolimab effectively disrupted this loop, highlighting IL-36 as a promising target for corticosteroid-resistant SS.
