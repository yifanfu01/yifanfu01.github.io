I finished this article in the PUMC with Dr. Jinxin TAO in 2024, supervised by Prof. Taiping ZHANG and Prof. Yupei ZHAO.

In this work, we utilize integrated single-cell RNA-sequencing, multi-omics and spatial RNA-seq data to uncover novel targets for therapeutic intervention as _TLR2_ in neutrophils in the PDAC TME. We profile the heterogeneity of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and pioneer the interaction between macrophages, T cells and neutrophils. We find the T cell dysfunction and inactive macrophages are associated with NETosis and ROS level. We also discover the potential subsequent collection and analysis of neutrophils from PDAC patients, which is challenging but promising.  

We are invited by _Nature Portfolio Communities_ to contribute a blog post on this topic.
