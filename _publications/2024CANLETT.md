I finished this article in the general surgery, PUMCH with Dr. Qiu, Dr. Liu, and Dr. Wang in 2024, supervised by Prof. Taiping ZHANG and Prof. Zhiyong Liang.

In this work, we propose the first RCCpm scRNA-seq landscape and evaluate the anti-angiogenesis treatment for the RCCpm patient.
Several primary and metastatic RCC kidney lesions, RCC bone marrow metastasis lesions as well as RCCpm lesions were included in this study. We observe heterogeneous karyocyte of epithelial and malignant cells. The PAX8-Myc pathway is considered as a potential key regultor for metastasis, which are confirmed by RCCpm FFPE samples. The Sunitinib is also evaluated as a effective AAT drug. The RCCpm TME is characterized while due to the limitation of sample size, it shoud be further investigated before clinical practice.
