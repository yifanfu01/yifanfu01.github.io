I finished this article in Lunar Palace 1 Lab, Beihang University with Dr. Yueying LU and my undergraduate classmates under the supervision from Prof. Yuming FU in 2023.  
  
This work simulated the effect of MG, LDIR and the combined effect on structure and antibiotic resistance of a synthetic community which we believed similar to the space environment. The bacteria in the synthetic community were isolated from spacecraft assembly room and exhibited a heterogeneity between different species.  

We believed this work will contribute to the control and utilization of microbial in the space environment.
