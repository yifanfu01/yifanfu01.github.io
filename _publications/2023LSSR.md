I participated this work in Lunar Palace 1 Lab, Beihang University with Dr. Yueying LU and my undergraduate classmates under the supervision from Prof. Yuming FU in 2023.  
  
Our study breaks new ground by analyzing the impact of combined microgravity and low-dose ionizing radiation, as found in space, on synthetic bacterial communities, revealing increased diversity, Bacilli proliferation, and antibiotic resistance. This research offers critical insights into microbial behavior in space, guiding strategies for astronaut health protection and microbial contamination control.

We believe it will contribute to the control and utilization of microbial as well as the healthy of astronauts in space .
