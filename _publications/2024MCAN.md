I designed and excuted this work in PUMCH, under the supervision from Prof. Taiping Zhang and Prof. Yupei Zhao.
  
Our study provide confident gene markers for single cell annotation usage, and also summurize cell subtype and their biological functions. Meanwhile, we also review some multiomics tools and algorithms and perscpect further application and analysis potential. 

We believe it will attract more attention on the rare cell types including neutrophils, endocrine cells etc.
