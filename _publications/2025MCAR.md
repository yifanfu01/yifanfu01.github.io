I finished this article in the general surgery, PUMCH with Dr. Liu, Dr. Liu in 2025, supervised by Prof. Taiping Zhang, Dr. Huang, and Dr. Qiu.

In this work, from the very beginning question: whether the different location of PDAC (head, body, and tail of pancreas) affect the outcome, we applied scRNA-seq, stRNA-seq, and bulk RNA seq on PDAC samples and Patient derived organoid (PDO) models. We identified the existence of SPP1+ venous endothelial cells in PDAC TME. Meanwhile, we found the Head PDAC have more CRABP2+ tumor cells infiltrated. Also, we verified the potential mechanism of CRABP2 in tumor cell. This work we proposed the potential molecular mechanism between different tumor location, which prompt us to continue discoverying scientific question based on clinical founds.

This work was also reported in CAP2025 (Chongqing, China).
