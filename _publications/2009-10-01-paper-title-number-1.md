I finished this article in Beihang University with Dr. Zhirong GUO and under the supervision from Dr. Shaocong MO and Prof. Wenchao GU in 2022.
This work collected the publib single nuclei RNA sequencing data from several literature and included AD and COVID-19 cohorts to reveal the potential shared mechanisms inducing cognitive impairment between these diseases. Several biomarkers were identified and a potential regulation target was proposed.
