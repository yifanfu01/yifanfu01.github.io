I finished this work in the PUMCH, together with other colleagues in 2025, supervised by Prof. Lixin Xie, Porf. Jingyu Chen, and Prof. Huaiyuan Chen, Prof.

This study represents the pioneer application of  [stGrads](https://stgrads.readthedocs.io), a computational framework I developed for analyzing spatial transcriptomic gradients. By integrating High-Definition Visium and scRNA-seq data through advanced deconvolution and spatial modeling, we decoded the transition between reversible repair and progressive fibrosis in ILDs. We identified that disease-specific niches (e.g., the B-cell–AT2–myofibroblast niche in OP) dictate fibroblast fate via distinct spatial signaling gradients. This work not only revealed the MIF-CD74 axis as a key driver of fibroblast migration but also established a robust bioinformatic pipeline for identifying spatial microenvironmental signatures, providing a blueprint for further spatial landscapes.  

Meanwhile, although several works chose to remove B-cell related genes like "JCHAIN" and "IGKC", we hereby provided evidence that these genes might also possess specific biological function. Simply removing antigen/B-cell related genes might contribute to artifical bias.
