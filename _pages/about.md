Welcome! 
  
I am currently a M.D. candidate at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). I am fortunately participating in the [4+4 Medical Doctor Program](https://mdadmission.pumc.edu.cn/mdweb/site!index). Before that, I finished my bachelor's degrees in biomedical engineering (BME) and math with honor (President's Award) from Beihang University in 2019. I am fortunate to be guided and mentored with so many great researchers and friends. I deeply appreciate their help: [Lab Experience](https://yifanfu01.github.io/cv/)  

My research interest focuses on the application of cumputational methods in the clinical research and fundamental research.  
As a M.D. candidate with multidisciplinary background, I am particularly interested in the intergration of multi-omics data and dedicate to hetergeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME). Recently, I worked with my colleagues from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) and revealed the heterogeneity of neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and identitied several promising prognostic markers. My goal is to clarify the sophisticated TME in the PDAC and promote the diagnosis and treatment of the PDAC. Meanwhile, I participated in some biomechanics projects by generating and evaluating the finated element analysis (FEA) models, with respect to the spine and zygoma.  

I am also the reviewer for the _Frontiers in Neurology_ and _Oral Dideases_ journals.
