Welcome! 
  
I am currently a M.D. candidate at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). I am fortunately participating in the [4+4 Medical Doctor Program](https://mdadmission.pumc.edu.cn/mdweb/site!index). Before that, I finished my bachelor's degrees in biomedical engineering (BME) and math with honor (President's Award) from Beihang University in 2019. I am fortunate to be guided and mentored with so many great researchers and friends. I deeply appreciate their help: [Lab Experience](https://yifanfu01.github.io/cv/).  

My research interest focuses on the application of cumputational methods in the both clinical and fundamental medical research. As a M.D. candidate with multidisciplinary background, I am particularly interested in the integration of multi-omics data and dedicate to formulating the sophisticated TME in the PDAC and promote the diagnosis and treatment of the PDAC. Recently, I, together with my colleagues from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), revealed the heterogeneity of neutrophils extracellular traps (NETs) in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and identitied several promising prognostic markers. Meanwhile, I participated in some biomechanics projects by generating and evaluating the finated element analysis (FEA) models, with respect to the spine and zygoma.  
  
My goal is to be a medical leaders with high morality, a vast knowledge base, solid clinical skills, and excellent professional qualities.  
  
I am the reviewer for the _Front Neurol_. and _Oral Dis_. journals.
