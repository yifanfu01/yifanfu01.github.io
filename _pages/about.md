I am currently a M.D. candidate at the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) & Peking Union Medical College (PUMC). I am fortunately participating in the [4+4 Medical Doctor Program](https://mdadmission.pumc.edu.cn/mdweb/site!index). Before that, I finished my bachelor's degrees in biomedical engineering (BME) and math with honor (President's Award) from Beihang University in 2023. I am fortunate to be guided and mentored with so many great researchers and friends. I deeply appreciate their help: [My Lab Experience](https://yifanfu01.github.io/cv/).  

My research interest focuses on the application of cumputational methods in the both clinical and fundamental medical research. As a M.D. candidate with multidisciplinary background, I am particularly interested in the integration of multi-omics data and dedicate to formulating the sophisticated microenvironment in the pancreatic cancer and other non-tumor diseases. Recently, I, together with my colleagues from Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH), revealed the neutrophil heterogenous (Neutrophil extracellular traps- like) maturation during the treatment of Î±IL-36 for sweet syndrome, which was the first analytic Visium HD article to our best knowledge. Meanwhile, I participated in some biomechanics projects by generating and evaluating the finated element analysis (FEA) models, with respect to the spine and zygoma.  
  
My goal is to be a medical leaders with high morality, a vast knowledge base, solid clinical skills, and excellent professional qualities.  
  
I am the reviewer for the _Front Genet_., _Front Neurol_., _Oral Dis_. and _Arch Gynecol Obstet_. journals.
